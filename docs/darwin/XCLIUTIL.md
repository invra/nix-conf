# Xcode Command Line Tools

**Xcode Command Line Tools (XCLT)** is a package provided by Apple that helps developers set up their development environments quickly and easily.

One common reason to install XCLT is to use **Git**, which is included in the tools.

## Installation

Installing XCLT is straightforward. In fact, running a command that depends on the tools will trigger the installation automatically.

To begin the installation:

```sh
git
````

You’ll be prompted to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Click “Next” and accept the license agreement.

> [!NOTE]
> The estimated download time shown by the installer is often wildly inaccurate.
> Even if it says “16 hours” or “2 days,” the process usually takes **less than 10 minutes**.

Once the installation is complete, verify it by running:

```sh
git
```

If everything is set up correctly, it will display Git’s usage information.

## Finished!

You’re all set! Head back to the [README](../README.md) to continue.

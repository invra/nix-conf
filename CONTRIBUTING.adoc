Thanks for showing interest in contributing! Your help is appreciated.

== Guidelines

* **Test on all platforms if possible**  
  - I would love to support platforms: aarch64-linux, x86_64-linux, aarch64-darwin
  - If you cannot test on a platform, submit your changes on a separate branch and clearly describe what you changed.

* **Code formatting**
  - Always run `nix fmt` on your changes before committing.
  - Well-formatted code helps everyone understand and maintain the project.

* **Submission method**
  - Contributions **must** be submitted via GitLab merge requests.
  - Any contributions sent elsewhere are considered a waste of time and may not be reviewed.

* **Documentation updates**
  - If your changes affect user-facing behavior, update the relevant documentation in the Wiki or README.

That's it! I don't actually expect much from contributions because it's all about having something that works â€” not
something which is *perfect* to look at. As long as the code works and is reasonably logical, it will be accepted.

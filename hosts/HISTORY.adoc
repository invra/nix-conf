= History/ Log of changes to hosts

This file is here mostly actually to log the deletion, creation, and reasoning for a host.

== History

=== mainpc-x86

The deletion of this configuration is due to the fact this computer hasnt been working for 6 months.

It is all due to hardware issues, mostly the fact that the motherboard is horrible with Linux support (__never get an MSi board to make sure you dont have my issue__).

When I am able to *rebuild* my system, it wont even be running with an Intel processor, so this computer configuration will be essentially useless.

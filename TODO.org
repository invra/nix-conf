* Todo List

Priority is measured by how essential the task is.  
This does NOT mean tasks will be completed in order, as some may be more resource-intensive than others.

   - [] Cleanup =utils= folder
   - [] Revise =configurations= folder structure 
   

** Make automation tools better
   - [] Add a Linux automation tool
   - [] Fact-check current logic

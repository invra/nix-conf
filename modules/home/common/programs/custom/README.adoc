== What is this Directory?

This directory is a collection of small workflow tools bundled into this flake I have made.  
Most of these utilities are written in Rust, and are designed to simplify common, repetitive tasks.

=== Purpose
These tools are not meant to replace full-featured system packages, but instead to:
- Streamline daily workflows
- Provide shorthand commands for common actions
- Reduce context-switching when working across multiple repositories or environments

=== Example Tool

==== `gc` â€” Git Clone (shorthand)
The `gc` command is a shorthand wrapper around `git clone`.  
It allows repositories to be cloned with shorter, more convenient syntax.

For example:

[source,shell]
----
# Normal Git usage
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Shorthand with gc
gc github:user/repo
----

This saves typing out the full repository URL each time, and can be extended with custom host aliases.

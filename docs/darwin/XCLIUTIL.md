# Xcode Command Line Tools
The XCLIT, is a package by Apple to help developers get development environments up and running.
Why we need this is to download Git.

## Installation
The experience gto download XCLIT is very simple, just type a command which is shipped with
XCLIT and it will install XCLIT with some intervention.

So run:
```sh
git
```

It will say that you need to install XCLIT, and hit next, and accept the terms. Pleas note
the estimated time is horribly wrong. It it says 16 hours or even 2 days, it will at most take
10 minutes.

Once you have been noitified its been installed you can type `git` again to test it's there.


## Finished!
Please go back go [the README](../README.md) to continue.

# Invra's Nix Flake.
This is a flake for NixOS, and also supports Nix-darwin! This is designed to me modular for other people to use. This <i>is</i> more for <u>advanced users</u> so if you are up for the
task to do this, this flake might be for you.

## Use
This flake is tailored for my use, it may align with yours, so here a list below.
* Keyboard centric
* Mostly Terminal centric
* Minimalism where wanted, but complexity for certain tasks. (Audio patch software, advanced networking support)
* Declarative, convenient, reproducible setup (3-10 commands and your good to go to be setup)
* Networking (docker, network manager, advanced interface configs for bridging.)

## Support
* `aarch64-darwin`
* `x86_64-linux`
* `aarch64-linux`

## Example

# Todo List

**Priority** is measured by how essential the task is.  
This does **not** mean tasks will be completed in order, as some may be more resource-intensive than others.

## Enhance Nix Configurations
Add more customisation options & features:

- [x] Add macOS Dock settings
- [ ] Add `ignorePackages` (to skip default packages)  
- [ ] Add `extraPackages` (to allow users to specify workflow-specific packages)  
- [x] Remove the need to include macOS-specific config in the Linux config (and vice versa)
- [ ] Add support to disable modules the user doesn't need
